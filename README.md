# CodeChef Daily Challenges

Welcome to my CodeChef daily practice repository! ðŸš€ 
Here, I will be solving CodeChef problems daily and documenting my progress.

## Solved Problems

| # | Problem Name             | Solution                                         |
|---|--------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| 1 | Subscriptions            | [Solution](<Solutions/Difficulty 504/READme.md>) |
| 2 | Greater Average          | [Solution](<Solutions/Difficulty 500/READme.md>) |
| 3 | Janmansh and Assignments | [Solution](<Solutions/Difficulty 513/READme.md>) |
| 4 | Exams                    | [Solution](<Solutions/Difficulty 519/READme.md>) |
| 5 | Minimum Cars required             | [Solution](<Solutions/Difficulty 608/READme.md>) |

## How This Works
- Each problem I solve will be added to the `Solutions` directory with a detailed explanation and solution.
- This main README will maintain a list of all solved problems.

## Goals
- Improve problem-solving skills.
- Maintain consistency in competitive programming.
- Track progress over time.

Stay tuned for daily updates! âœ¨
