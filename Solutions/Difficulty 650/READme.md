## 6. Mario and Bullet
### Problem Statement
Mario's bullet moves at ```X``` pixels per frame. He wishes to shoot a goomba standing ```Y``` pixels away from him. The goomba does not move. 

Find the <strong>minimum</strong> time (in seconds) after which Mario should shoot the bullet, such that it hits the goomba after <strong>at least</strong> ```Z``` seconds from now.

### Input Format
- The first line contains a single integer ```T``` — the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
- Each test case consists of a single line of input, containing three space-separated integers ```X```,```Y```, and ```Z```.

### Output Format
For each test case, output in a single line the <strong>minimum</strong> time (in seconds) after which Mario should shoot the bullet, such that it hits the goomba after <strong>at least</strong> ```Z``` seconds from now.

### Constraints
- 1 ≤ T ≤ 100
- 1 ≤ X, Y, Z ≤ 100
- X divides Y
