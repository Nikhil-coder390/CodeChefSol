## 3. Janmansh and Assignments
### Problem Statement
Janmansh has to submit ```3``` for Chingari before ```10``` pm and he starts to do the assignments at ```X``` pm. Each assignment takes him ```1``` hour to complete. Can you tell whether he'll be able to complete all assignments on time or not?

### Input Format
- The first line contains a single integer ```T``` â€” the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
- The first and only line of each test case contains two integer ```X``` - the time when Janmansh starts doing the assignments.

### Output Format
For each test case, output ```Yes``` if he can complete the assignments on time. Otherwise, output ```No```.

You may print each character of ```Yes``` and ```No``` in uppercase or lowercase (for example, ```yes```, ```yEs```, ```YES``` will be considered identical).

### Constraints
- 1 â‰¤ T â‰¤ 10
- 1 â‰¤ X â‰¤ 9
